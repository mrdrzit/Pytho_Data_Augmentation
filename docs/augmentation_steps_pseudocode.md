#### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

1. **Import** the necessary libraries:
    - **Import** the library for handling dataframes.
    - **Import** the library for numerical operations.
    - **Import** the library for image processing.
    - **Import** the library for image augmentation.
    - **Import** the library for handling file paths and directories.

#### Step 2: Load Dataset

1. **Read** the CSV file that contains the labels.
2. **Initialize** an empty list to store image data and labels.
3. **For each** row in the CSV file:
    - **Get** the path to the image from the current row.
    - **Read** the image from the path.
    - **Get** the keypoints (label points) from the current row.
    - **Append** the image and its keypoints to the list.

#### Step 3: Define Augmentation Pipeline

1. **Define** a sequence of augmentations:
    - **Include** a horizontal flip with a 50% chance.
    - **Include** a rotation between -25 and 25 degrees.
    - **Include** scaling between 80% and 120%.
    - **Include** brightness adjustment between 80% and 120%.

    Augmentation list:
    # Gamma contrast
    # Sigmoid contrast
    # Sharpen
    # Rotate
    # Multiply Saturation
    # Remove Saturation
    # Motion Blur
    

#### Step 4: Apply Augmentation and Adjust Keypoints

1. **Initialize** an empty list to store augmented data.
2. **For each** item in the list of image data:
    - **Get** the image from the current item.
    - **Get** the keypoints from the current item.
    - **Convert** the keypoints to a format that the augmentation library can use.
    - **Apply** the augmentations to the image and keypoints.
    - **Extract** the augmented keypoints into a list.
    - **Append** the augmented image and keypoints to the list of augmented data.

#### Step 5: Save Augmented Images and Create New CSV

1. **Create** a directory to store the augmented data.
2. **Initialize** an empty list to store new rows for the CSV file.
3. **For each** item in the list of augmented data:
    - **Get** the augmented image from the current item.
    - **Get** the augmented keypoints from the current item.
    - **Generate** a file path for the augmented image.
    - **Save** the augmented image to the file path.
    - **Prepare** a new row for the CSV file with the file path and keypoints.
    - **Append** the new row to the list of rows.
4. **Create** a new dataframe from the list of rows.
5. **Save** the new dataframe to a CSV file in the directory.

#### Step 6: Verify and Retrain

1. **Import** the DeepLabCut library.
2. **Load** the new CSV file and images into DeepLabCut.
3. **Train** the network using the new data.

### Summary

- **Step 1:** Import the libraries needed for the task.
- **Step 2:** Load the images and their labels from the CSV file into a list.
- **Step 3:** Define how to augment the images (e.g., flip, rotate, scale).
- **Step 4:** Apply these augmentations to each image and adjust the labels accordingly.
- **Step 5:** Save the augmented images and create a new CSV file with the updated labels.
- **Step 6:** Use the new dataset to retrain the model.
